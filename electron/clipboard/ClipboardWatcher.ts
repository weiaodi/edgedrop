 * Reports genuinely new clipboard content.

 * Windows Explorer delay-renders formats after a copy (paths, then bitmap,
 * then extra shell data). Each render bumps the sequence number. Reading the
 * clipboard inside WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE forces the next render and looks like
 * many copies of the same files. We therefore:
 *   1. Detect change via GetClipboardSequenceNumber only (no OpenClipboard).
 *   2. Reset a settle window on every bump and capture once it is quiet.
 *   3. Ignore a second capture of the same content for a short coalescing
 *      window so late Explorer thumbnails do not bump hitCount.
 *   4. Never re-read a just-captured file list during that window — another
 *      OpenClipboard restarts Explorer's delay-render and hitCount climbs.
 *   5. If the path list is unchanged, ignore later sequence bumps entirely.
 *      Closing Explorer flushes delayed formats (WM_RENDERALLFORMATS) seconds
 *      later and would otherwise look like a second copy.
 * A slow interval remains as a fallback if the OS message is missed.

   * 2. Allow re-capture after genuine re-copy: when the user later copies
   *    something different and then copies the original content again, the
   *    clipboard WILL change (different → original), so the watcher will detect
   *    the change and re-capture it correctly.
   *
   * NOTE: The one edge case this does NOT solve is: user copies X, deletes X
   * from Edge-Drop, then immediately copies X again WITHOUT copying anything
   * else in between (system clipboard never changed). In that narrow case we
   * cannot detect the re-copy because the OS clipboard didn't change. This is
   * an acceptable limitation — the common-case fix (zombie prevention) is far
